## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Recent Decisions (2025-10-26)

- **Decision**: Group related ORM models by domain in single files
  - Date: 2025-10-26
  - Context: Implementing SQLAlchemy models for chain registry and configuration
  - Pattern: `chains.py` contains Chain, Provider, ChainProviderMapping, CanonicalPeriod, CanonicalValidatorIdentity
  - Rationale:
    - Related entities belong together (Chain, Provider, and their mapping are tightly coupled)
    - Easier to understand relationships when models are co-located
    - Follows project structure guidance: "Group related entities by domain"
    - Prevents file proliferation (5 models in 1 file vs 5 separate files)
  - Future application:
    - `staging.py` will contain IngestionRun and StagingPayload models
    - `canonical.py` will contain all canonical data models
    - `computation.py` will contain ValidatorPnL and commission models
  - Trade-offs: Larger files, but better cohesion and discoverability

- **Decision**: Use async database fixtures with per-test isolation
  - Date: 2025-10-26
  - Context: Testing ORM models with real database operations
  - Implementation: Each test gets fresh database (create tables → test → drop tables)
  - Rationale:
    - True test isolation - no data leakage between tests
    - Tests real database behavior (not mocked)
    - Simpler than complex transaction rollback patterns
    - Works reliably with async SQLAlchemy
  - Configuration: `tests/conftest.py` with `db_session` fixture
  - Performance: Acceptable for unit tests (<3s for 20 tests)
  - Trade-offs: Slower than transaction rollback, but more reliable

- **Decision**: Support multi-chain validator identities in single model
  - Date: 2025-10-26
  - Context: CanonicalValidatorIdentity needs to work for Solana and Ethereum
  - Implementation: Optional fields for chain-specific identifiers
    - Solana: vote_pubkey, node_pubkey, identity_pubkey (all optional)
    - Ethereum: fee_recipient (optional)
    - Common: validator_key (required, canonical identifier)
  - Rationale:
    - Single source of truth for validator identities
    - Cleaner than separate tables per chain or polymorphic associations
    - Simple to extend for new chains (add optional fields)
    - Query simplicity - no complex joins needed
  - Validation: Application-level validation ensures chain-appropriate fields are populated

### Previous Decisions (2025-10-23)

- **Decision**: Simplify project structure from `src/aurora/` to `src/`
  - Date: 2025-10-23
  - Rationale: Eliminate redundancy since project is already named "aurora"
  - Alternatives considered:
    - Keep `src/aurora/` (rejected due to import verbosity)
    - Flat structure without `src/` (rejected, not Pythonic)
  - Impact: Cleaner imports (`from config.X` vs `from aurora.config.X`)
  - Validation: All 58 tests passing, mypy validation successful
  - Trade-offs: Required one-time refactoring effort, but long-term maintainability improved

- **Decision**: Use async SQLAlchemy with connection pooling
  - Date: 2025-10-23
  - Context: Need production-ready database layer for FastAPI
  - Configuration: pool_size=10, max_overflow=20, pool_pre_ping=True, pool_recycle=3600
  - Rationale:
    - Async matches FastAPI's async architecture
    - Connection pooling for performance and resource efficiency
    - pool_pre_ping prevents stale connections
    - pool_recycle avoids long-lived connection issues
  - Impact: Foundation for all future database operations
  - Dependencies: PostgreSQL 15+ via Docker Compose

- **Decision**: Docker Compose for local development infrastructure
  - Date: 2025-10-23
  - Services: PostgreSQL 15-alpine + Redis 7-alpine
  - Rationale:
    - Consistent development environment across team
    - Easy setup and teardown
    - Matches production deployment strategy (on-premise containers)
  - Trade-offs: Requires Docker installed, but provides isolation and consistency

### Technical Debt & Issues

## Current Technical Debt
None identified. Project is in initial setup phase with clean architecture.

## Next Session Goals

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Primary Goal**: Implement next phase of database layer
   - Suggested next tasks (check GitHub for prioritization):
     - **Alembic migrations**: Create initial migration for chain registry models
     - **Staging layer models**: IngestionRun and StagingPayload ORM models
     - **Canonical layer models**: CanonicalValidatorFees, CanonicalValidatorMev, CanonicalStakeRewards, CanonicalValidatorMeta
   - Prerequisites:
     - Chain registry models implemented ✅ (Issue #6)
     - Database infrastructure ready ✅ (Issue #3)
   - Current branch: `main` (ready for new feature branch)

2. **Database Migrations**: Set up Alembic for schema management
   - Create `alembic.ini` configuration
   - Initialize Alembic migrations directory
   - Generate initial migration from chain registry models
   - Test migration up/down/rollback functionality
   - Success criteria: `alembic upgrade head` creates all chain registry tables

### Knowledge Gaps

## Knowledge Gaps to Address
No critical knowledge gaps identified. Next implementation details will depend on the next GitHub issue selected.

# Task Management & Handoff Template

This file manages task continuity, session transitions, and knowledge transfer for AI-assisted development sessions.

## Purpose

This template helps maintain:
- **Session continuity** between AI development sessions
- **Task status tracking** for complex, multi-session work
- **Context preservation** when switching between team members
- **Knowledge transfer** for project handoffs
- **Progress documentation** for ongoing development efforts

### Completed Tasks

## Completed This Session (2025-10-23)

- [x] **Project Structure Refactoring**
  - Completed: 2025-10-23
  - Outcome: Simplified from `src/aurora/` to `src/` structure
  - Files changed:
    - `pyproject.toml` (added package-mode=false, updated paths)
    - All source files (updated imports from `aurora.X` to `X`)
    - Test directory renamed from `tests/unit/config/` to `tests/unit/test_config/`
    - Added `conftest.py` for pytest path configuration
  - Impact: Cleaner imports, better FastAPI alignment, eliminated redundancy
  - All 58 tests passing with 97% coverage

- [x] **GitHub Issue #3: PostgreSQL and Docker Compose Setup**
  - Completed: 2025-10-23
  - Outcome: Production-ready database infrastructure implemented
  - Files created:
    - `docker-compose.yml` (PostgreSQL 15 + Redis 7 with health checks)
    - `.env.example` (environment variable template)
    - `src/db/session.py` (async SQLAlchemy session factory)
    - `src/db/__init__.py` (clean module interface)
  - Files modified:
    - `src/config/settings.py` (added database pool settings)
  - Database connection tested and validated successfully
  - GitHub issue closed with detailed implementation comment

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Recent Decisions (2025-10-23)

- **Decision**: Simplify project structure from `src/aurora/` to `src/`
  - Date: 2025-10-23
  - Rationale: Eliminate redundancy since project is already named "aurora"
  - Alternatives considered:
    - Keep `src/aurora/` (rejected due to import verbosity)
    - Flat structure without `src/` (rejected, not Pythonic)
  - Impact: Cleaner imports (`from config.X` vs `from aurora.config.X`)
  - Validation: All 58 tests passing, mypy validation successful
  - Trade-offs: Required one-time refactoring effort, but long-term maintainability improved

- **Decision**: Use async SQLAlchemy with connection pooling
  - Date: 2025-10-23
  - Context: Need production-ready database layer for FastAPI
  - Configuration: pool_size=10, max_overflow=20, pool_pre_ping=True, pool_recycle=3600
  - Rationale:
    - Async matches FastAPI's async architecture
    - Connection pooling for performance and resource efficiency
    - pool_pre_ping prevents stale connections
    - pool_recycle avoids long-lived connection issues
  - Impact: Foundation for all future database operations
  - Dependencies: PostgreSQL 15+ via Docker Compose

- **Decision**: Docker Compose for local development infrastructure
  - Date: 2025-10-23
  - Services: PostgreSQL 15-alpine + Redis 7-alpine
  - Rationale:
    - Consistent development environment across team
    - Easy setup and teardown
    - Matches production deployment strategy (on-premise containers)
  - Trade-offs: Requires Docker installed, but provides isolation and consistency

### Technical Debt & Issues

## Current Technical Debt
None identified. Project is in initial setup phase with clean architecture.

## Next Session Goals

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Primary Goal**: Identify and implement next GitHub issue
   - Success criteria: Check GitHub repository for open issues, select appropriate task
   - Prerequisites: GitHub issues #1, #2, #3 are closed ✅
   - Current branch: `main` (ready for new feature branch)

2. **Development Setup**: Verify Docker Compose works for new developers
   - Test: `docker-compose up -d` starts PostgreSQL and Redis successfully
   - Test: Database connection validation passes
   - Verify: `.env.example` has all required variables documented

### Knowledge Gaps

## Knowledge Gaps to Address
No critical knowledge gaps identified. Next implementation details will depend on the next GitHub issue selected.

## Context for Continuation

### Key Files & Components

## Recently Modified Files (Session 2025-10-23)

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
```
Phase 1 (Backend) → Phase 2a (Schemas) → Phase 2b (Services) → Phase 3 (Seeding)
                                                                        ↓
                                                                  Phase 4 (Frontend Auth)
                                                                        ↓
                                  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┐
                                  ↓                                     ↓                                 ↓
                            Phase 5a (Dashboard)              Phase 5b (Partners)              Phase 5c (Commissions)
                                  └─────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┘
                                                                        ↓
                                                                  Phase 6 (Testing & Polish)
                                                                        ↓
                                                              Phase 7 (Optional - Real Data)
```

**Key Decisions:**
- **Fast-track timeline**: 2-3 weeks to working demo (vs 6-8 weeks for full implementation)
- **Seeded data strategy**: Use realistic test data to avoid 2-3 week ingestion pipeline build
- **Admin-only auth**: Defer partner portal to post-MVP (saves 1 week)
- **CLIENT_REVENUE method only**: Simple commission calculation (10% of revenue) for MVP
- **Desktop-only UI**: Responsive design deferred to post-MVP
- **Optional stretch goal**: Real data integration if all phases complete early

**Out of Scope (Post-MVP):**
- ❌ Partner login portal
- ❌ Payment tracking and status
- ❌ Multi-chain support beyond Solana (Ethereum deferred to M1)

**Previous Work Context:**
Prior to MVP planning, Issue #13 (Jito MEV adapter) was implemented and merged, completing the adapter foundation for Solana MEV data ingestion.

#### Issue #13 - Jito MEV Adapter (COMPLETED 2025-10-28)

**What was completed:**
- ✅ Jito adapter implementation for Solana MEV tips (`src/adapters/solana/jito.py`)
- ✅ Comprehensive test fixtures (`tests/fixtures/jito_responses.json`)
- ✅ 19 unit tests with 85% code coverage (`tests/unit/test_jito_adapter.py`)
- ✅ Factory integration for automatic adapter registration
- ✅ Updated test suite for factory MEV adapter creation
- ✅ All quality gates passing: mypy ✅ ruff ✅ pytest ✅

**Key Implementation Details:**
- GET /api/v1/validators/{vote_account} endpoint
- Returns MEV tips per epoch with commission rates
- Graceful handling of missing epochs (returns zero MEV)
- tip_count approximation (0 if no MEV, 1 if MEV exists)
- Exception-based error handling with ProviderError hierarchy

**Files Created:**
- `src/adapters/solana/jito.py` (305 lines)
- `tests/fixtures/jito_responses.json` (77 lines)
- `tests/unit/test_jito_adapter.py` (418 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/adapters/factory.py` - Added Jito adapter auto-registration
- `src/adapters/solana/__init__.py` - Added Jito to exports
- `tests/unit/test_adapters_factory.py` - Updated factory tests for MEV adapter

**Test Coverage:**
- 19 tests across 7 test classes
- TestJitoAdapterInitialization (2 tests)
- TestGetValidatorPeriodMEV (6 tests)
- TestGetValidatorMeta (5 tests)
- TestUnsupportedMethods (3 tests)
- TestErrorHandling (2 tests)
- TestResourceCleanup (1 test)

**Architecture Notes:**
- Focused adapter: Only implements MEV methods (not fees or rewards)
- NotImplementedError for unsupported methods (list_periods, get_fees, get_stake_rewards)
- Reuses HTTPAdapter base class for HTTP client functionality
- Follows established adapter pattern from SolanaBeachAdapter

#### Issue #10 - Alembic Migrations (COMPLETED 2025-10-27)

**What was completed:**
- ✅ Alembic initialized with async SQLAlchemy support
- ✅ Initial migration generated for all 18 ORM models (chains, staging, canonical, computation)

- ✅ Migration tested: upgrade → downgrade → upgrade cycle
- ✅ Migration management script created (`scripts/migrate.sh`)
- ✅ Comprehensive migration guide (`docs/migration-guide.md`)
- ✅ All quality gates passing: mypy ✅ ruff ✅ black ✅

**Key features:**
- Async SQLAlchemy engine support via `run_sync()`
- Auto-detection of model changes for future migrations
- Environment variable configuration (DATABASE_URL from settings)
- Proper handling of PostgreSQL ENUM types in downgrades
- Multi-environment support (dev, staging, prod)
- Management script with upgrade, downgrade, history, current, create, reset commands

**Database state:**
- 18 tables created: chains, providers, chain_provider_mappings, canonical_periods, canonical_validator_identities, partners, agreements, agreement_versions, agreement_rules, ingestion_runs, staging_payloads, canonical_validator_fees, canonical_validator_mev, canonical_stake_rewards, canonical_validator_meta, validator_pnl, partner_commission_lines, partner_commission_statements
- 4 ENUM types: ingestionstatus, datatype, agreementstatus, revenuecomponent, attributionmethod, statementstatus
- Current revision: cec3a80e61a4 (head)

#### Issue #9 - Computation Layer ORM Models (COMPLETED 2025-10-27)

**What was completed:**
- ✅ 7 models: ValidatorPnL, Partners, Agreements, AgreementVersions, AgreementRules, PartnerCommissionLines, PartnerCommissionStatements
- ✅ 4 enums: AgreementStatus, RevenueComponent, AttributionMethod, StatementStatus
- ✅ Bidirectional relationships with Chain and CanonicalPeriod models
- ✅ 22 comprehensive unit tests with 100% code coverage for computation.py
- ✅ All quality gates passing: mypy ✅ ruff ✅ black ✅ pytest (122 tests)
- ✅ Test coverage improved to 84%
- ✅ Fixed SQLAlchemy reserved name (`metadata` → `statement_metadata`)
- ✅ Proper cascade delete handling for Agreement relationships

**Key design patterns:**
- NUMERIC(38,18) for all revenue amounts
- CASCADE delete for chain/period (data lifecycle)
- RESTRICT delete for partner/agreement (data protection)
- Composite foreign keys for agreement versioning
- Check constraints: positive amounts, valid rate ranges (0-10000 bps)
- Unique constraints: preventing duplicate P&L records and commission statements

#### Issue #8 - Canonical Layer ORM Models (COMPLETED 2025-10-26)

**What was completed:**
- ✅ 4 canonical models: CanonicalValidatorFees, CanonicalValidatorMEV, CanonicalStakeRewards, CanonicalValidatorMeta

- ✅ CanonicalStakeRewards supports both aggregated and per-staker detail (staker_address NULL vs populated)
- ✅ Full source attribution via source_provider_id and source_payload_id for traceability
- ✅ Bidirectional relationships with Chain, CanonicalPeriod, Provider, and StagingPayload
- ✅ 11 comprehensive unit tests with 100% code coverage for canonical.py
- ✅ All quality gates passing: mypy ✅ ruff ✅ black ✅ pytest (100 tests)
- ✅ Test coverage improved to 79%

**Key design patterns:**
- CASCADE delete for chain/period (data lifecycle)
- RESTRICT delete for provider/staging (data protection)
- Check constraints: positive amounts, commission_rate_bps 0-10000, uptime_percentage 0-100
- Composite indexes on (chain_id, period_id, validator_key) for query performance

## Completed Work Summary

### Data Layer (Issues #6, #7, #8, #9)
- ✅ **Issue #6**: Chain registry models (Chain, Provider, ChainProviderMapping, CanonicalPeriod, CanonicalValidatorIdentity)
- ✅ **Issue #7**: Staging layer models (IngestionRun, StagingPayload + enums)
- ✅ **Issue #8**: Canonical layer models (CanonicalValidatorFees, CanonicalValidatorMEV, CanonicalStakeRewards, CanonicalValidatorMeta)
- ✅ **Issue #9**: Computation layer models (ValidatorPnL, Partners, Agreements, AgreementVersions, AgreementRules, PartnerCommissionLines, PartnerCommissionStatements)

### Database Migrations (Issue #10)
- ✅ **Issue #10**: Alembic migrations with async SQLAlchemy support, management scripts, and comprehensive documentation

### Infrastructure (Issue #3 + Security)
- ✅ **Issue #3**: PostgreSQL + Redis Docker Compose setup
- ✅ **Security**: Input validation, SQL injection protection (`src/core/security.py`)
- ✅ **Logging**: Structured logging with PII filtering (`src/core/logging.py`)
- ✅ **Testing**: Async database fixtures with per-test isolation

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### ORM Model Organization
- **Pattern**: Group related models by domain in single files
- **Examples**:
  - `chains.py` - Chain registry and configuration (5 models)
  - `staging.py` - Data ingestion (2 models + 2 enums)
  - `canonical.py` - Normalized data (4 models)
  - `computation.py` - P&L and commissions (pending Issue #9)
- **Rationale**: Better cohesion, easier to understand relationships, prevents file proliferation

### Database Precision
- **NUMERIC(38,18)** for all blockchain-native amounts (lamports, wei, gwei)
- Maintains 18 decimal places of precision
- Prevents floating-point arithmetic errors
- Supports both Solana (lamports: 10^9 per SOL) and Ethereum (wei: 10^18 per ETH)

### Data Traceability
- Every canonical model has `source_provider_id` and `source_payload_id`
- Full audit trail from raw staging data to normalized canonical data
- Enables debugging, verification, and re-computation

### Testing Strategy
- Async database fixtures with per-test isolation
- Real database operations (not mocked)
- Each test: create tables → test → drop tables
- 100% coverage requirement for new ORM models

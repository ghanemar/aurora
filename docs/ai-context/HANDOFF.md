## Current Session Status

### Active Tasks
**Ready for Issue #8: Canonical Layer ORM Models** (recommended next task)

### Recent Work (Session 2025-10-26)

- ✅ Implemented IngestionRun model with status tracking and job metadata
- ✅ Implemented StagingPayload model with JSONB payload and full traceability
- ✅ Added Python Enums (IngestionStatus, DataType) for type safety
- ✅ Updated chains.py with reverse relationships (ingestion_runs, staging_payloads)
- ✅ Created 11 comprehensive unit tests covering creation, validation, relationships, and cascades
- ✅ All quality gates passing: mypy ✅ ruff ✅ black ✅ pytest (89 tests)
- ✅ Test coverage improved to 75% (from 72%)
- ✅ Fixed SQLAlchemy reserved keyword issue (metadata → job_metadata)

### Previous Work (Session 2025-10-26)

**Phase 1: ORM Models Implementation**
- ✅ Implemented GitHub Issue #6: SQLAlchemy ORM models for chain registry and configuration
- ✅ Created 5 core models (Chain, Provider, ChainProviderMapping, CanonicalPeriod, CanonicalValidatorIdentity)
- ✅ Built comprehensive test suite with 20 unit tests, all passing
- ✅ Set up async database test fixtures with proper isolation
- ✅ Closed GitHub Issue #6 with detailed completion comment

**Phase 2: Security & Quality Improvements**
- ✅ Fixed mypy configuration (namespace_packages issue resolved)
- ✅ Fixed all ruff linting errors (16 auto-fixed in src/ and tests/)
- ✅ Created `src/core/security.py` - Input validation & SQL injection protection
  - Chain ID validation, identifier validation, pagination helpers
  - SQL injection keyword detection and sanitization
  - Pydantic models for safe query filters
- ✅ Created `src/core/logging.py` - Security-aware structured logging
  - PII filtering (auto-redacts passwords, tokens, secrets)
  - JSON structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Security event helpers (auth attempts, permission denials, rate limits, data access)
- ✅ Updated `src/config/settings.py` with 9 new security settings
  - Request size limits, rate limiting config, CORS settings, API key auth
- ✅ Updated `.env.example` with all new security configuration
- ✅ All quality gates passing: mypy (14 files), ruff (0 errors), black (formatted), pytest (78 tests)
- ✅ Test coverage improved to 72% (from 48%)

### Pending Tasks
**Recommended Next: Issue #8 - Canonical Layer ORM Models**

Why Issue #8 makes sense now:
- Data flow progression: Ingestion → Staging → **Canonical** → Computation
- Natural next step after staging layer completion
- Required for computation layer (Issue #9)
- Pattern well-established from Issues #6 and #7
- Medium-high complexity (4-6 days effort) - multiple canonical tables

**Other Open Issues** (Phase 2 - Data Layer):
- Issue #9: Computation & agreements models (depends on canonical)
- Issue #10: Alembic migrations (should wait until canonical + computation complete)

**Later Phases:**
- Issues #4-5: Authentication & RBAC (Phase 1, can be done anytime)
- Issues #11-14: Adapters (Phase 3, requires staging models)
- Issues #15-17: Services & API (Phase 4-6, requires data layer complete)

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Recent Decisions (2025-10-26)

- **Decision**: Group related ORM models by domain in single files
  - Date: 2025-10-26
  - Context: Implementing SQLAlchemy models for chain registry and configuration
  - Pattern: `chains.py` contains Chain, Provider, ChainProviderMapping, CanonicalPeriod, CanonicalValidatorIdentity
  - Rationale:
    - Related entities belong together (Chain, Provider, and their mapping are tightly coupled)
    - Easier to understand relationships when models are co-located
    - Follows project structure guidance: "Group related entities by domain"
    - Prevents file proliferation (5 models in 1 file vs 5 separate files)
  - Future application:
    - `staging.py` will contain IngestionRun and StagingPayload models
    - `canonical.py` will contain all canonical data models
    - `computation.py` will contain ValidatorPnL and commission models
  - Trade-offs: Larger files, but better cohesion and discoverability

- **Decision**: Use async database fixtures with per-test isolation
  - Date: 2025-10-26
  - Context: Testing ORM models with real database operations
  - Implementation: Each test gets fresh database (create tables → test → drop tables)
  - Rationale:
    - True test isolation - no data leakage between tests
    - Tests real database behavior (not mocked)
    - Simpler than complex transaction rollback patterns
    - Works reliably with async SQLAlchemy
  - Configuration: `tests/conftest.py` with `db_session` fixture
  - Performance: Acceptable for unit tests (<3s for 20 tests)
  - Trade-offs: Slower than transaction rollback, but more reliable

- **Decision**: Support multi-chain validator identities in single model
  - Date: 2025-10-26
  - Context: CanonicalValidatorIdentity needs to work for Solana and Ethereum
  - Implementation: Optional fields for chain-specific identifiers
    - Solana: vote_pubkey, node_pubkey, identity_pubkey (all optional)
    - Ethereum: fee_recipient (optional)
    - Common: validator_key (required, canonical identifier)
  - Rationale:
    - Single source of truth for validator identities
    - Cleaner than separate tables per chain or polymorphic associations
    - Simple to extend for new chains (add optional fields)
    - Query simplicity - no complex joins needed
  - Validation: Application-level validation ensures chain-appropriate fields are populated

### Previous Decisions (2025-10-23)

- **Decision**: Simplify project structure from `src/aurora/` to `src/`
  - Date: 2025-10-23
  - Rationale: Eliminate redundancy since project is already named "aurora"
  - Alternatives considered:
    - Keep `src/aurora/` (rejected due to import verbosity)
    - Flat structure without `src/` (rejected, not Pythonic)
  - Impact: Cleaner imports (`from config.X` vs `from aurora.config.X`)
  - Validation: All 58 tests passing, mypy validation successful
  - Trade-offs: Required one-time refactoring effort, but long-term maintainability improved

- **Decision**: Use async SQLAlchemy with connection pooling
  - Date: 2025-10-23
  - Context: Need production-ready database layer for FastAPI
  - Configuration: pool_size=10, max_overflow=20, pool_pre_ping=True, pool_recycle=3600
  - Rationale:
    - Async matches FastAPI's async architecture
    - Connection pooling for performance and resource efficiency
    - pool_pre_ping prevents stale connections
    - pool_recycle avoids long-lived connection issues
  - Impact: Foundation for all future database operations
  - Dependencies: PostgreSQL 15+ via Docker Compose

- **Decision**: Docker Compose for local development infrastructure
  - Date: 2025-10-23
  - Services: PostgreSQL 15-alpine + Redis 7-alpine
  - Rationale:
    - Consistent development environment across team
    - Easy setup and teardown
    - Matches production deployment strategy (on-premise containers)
  - Trade-offs: Requires Docker installed, but provides isolation and consistency

### Technical Debt & Issues

## Current Technical Debt
None identified. Project is in initial setup phase with clean architecture.

## Next Session Goals

### Immediate Priorities

1. **PRIMARY GOAL: Issue #7 - Staging Layer ORM Models**
   - **Why this task**:
     - Natural data flow progression: Ingestion → Staging → Canonical → Computation
     - Required before building adapters (Issues #11-14)
     - Security & validation infrastructure now ready for use
     - Pattern established from Issue #6 to follow
   - **Models to implement**:
     - `IngestionRun` - Metadata for ingestion jobs (provider, chain, period, status tracking)
     - `StagingPayload` - Raw provider data storage with JSONB payload and full traceability
   - **Prerequisites**: ✅ All complete
     - Chain registry models implemented (Issue #6)
     - Database infrastructure ready (Issue #3)
     - Security & validation utilities available (`src/core/security.py`)
     - Logging infrastructure available (`src/core/logging.py`)
   - **Reference**:
     - Follow pattern from `src/core/models/chains.py`
     - Refer to `docs/database-schema.md` (Section 2: Staging Layer)
     - Use async test fixtures from `tests/conftest.py`
   - **Deliverables**:
     - `src/core/models/staging.py` with IngestionRun and StagingPayload models
     - Comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/test_models_staging.py`
     - All constraints, indexes, and relationships from schema
     - Test coverage for create, validate, query, and relationships
   - **Suggested branch**: `feature/issue-7-staging-models`
   - **Estimated effort**: 3-5 days (medium complexity)

2. **SECONDARY: After Issue #7 completion**
   - **Issue #8**: Canonical layer models (requires staging foundation)
   - **Issue #10**: Alembic migrations (should wait for most models to be complete)
   - **Issues #4-5**: Authentication & RBAC (can be done independently)

3. **NOT RECOMMENDED YET**:
   - Alembic migrations (wait until staging + canonical models complete)
   - Adapters (require staging models)
   - Services/API (require complete data layer)

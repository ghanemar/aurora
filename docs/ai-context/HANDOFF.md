**Critical Path Dependencies:**
```
Phase 1 (Backend) → Phase 2a (Schemas) → Phase 2b (Services) → Phase 3 (Seeding)
                                                                        ↓

                                                                        ↓
                                  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┐
                                  ↓                                     ↓                                 ↓
                            Phase 5a (Dashboard)              Phase 5b (Partners)              Phase 5c (Commissions)
                                  └─────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┘
                                                                        ↓

```

**Key Decisions:**
- **Fast-track timeline**: 2-3 weeks to working demo (vs 6-8 weeks for full implementation)
- **Seeded data strategy**: Use realistic test data to avoid 2-3 week ingestion pipeline build
- **Admin-only auth**: Defer partner portal to post-MVP (saves 1 week)
- **CLIENT_REVENUE method only**: Simple commission calculation (10% of revenue) for MVP
- **Desktop-only UI**: Responsive design deferred to post-MVP
- **Optional stretch goal**: Real data integration if all phases complete early

**Out of Scope (Post-MVP):**
- ❌ Partner login portal
- ❌ Payment tracking and status
- ❌ Multi-chain support beyond Solana (Ethereum deferred to M1)
- ❌ Automated data ingestion pipelines
- ❌ Advanced commission methods

- Check constraints: positive amounts, commission_rate_bps 0-10000, uptime_percentage 0-100
- Composite indexes on (chain_id, period_id, validator_key) for query performance

#### Issue #21 - MVP Phase 3: Data Seeding Script (COMPLETED 2025-10-29)

**What was completed:**
- ✅ Comprehensive idempotent seed script (`scripts/seed_mvp_data.py`)
- ✅ Realistic Solana mainnet test data with 3 validators
- ✅ 2 partners with active agreements and commission rules
- ✅ 3 epochs of financial data (epochs 850-852)
- ✅ Complete staging layer with ingestion runs and payloads
- ✅ Full data traceability from staging to canonical to computation
- ✅ PostgreSQL idempotency using INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
- ✅ Fixed enum value handling for User model
- ✅ README.md updated with seeding instructions

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Realistic Amounts**: Per validator per epoch:
  - Execution Fees: 50 SOL (50,000,000,000 lamports)
  - MEV Tips: 30 SOL (30,000,000,000 lamports)
  - Vote Rewards: 100 SOL (100,000,000,000 lamports)
  - Total Revenue: 180 SOL per validator per epoch
- **Commission Structure**:
  - Partner 1: 10% (1000 bps) on MEV_TIPS for validators 1-2
  - Partner 2: 15% (1500 bps) on MEV_TIPS for validator 3
- **Idempotency Pattern**: Used `on_conflict_do_nothing(index_elements=[...])` for all inserts
- **Full Traceability**: IngestionRun → StagingPayload → Canonical → ValidatorPnL
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: For staging payload response_hash

**Seed Data Structure:**
```
1 Admin User (admin/admin123)
1 Chain (solana-mainnet)
1 Provider (Jito)
3 Validators (real mainnet vote pubkeys)
2 Partners (Global Stake Partners, Decentralized Validators Group)
3 Canonical Periods (epochs 850-852)
2 Agreements (ACTIVE status)
2 Agreement Versions (version 1)
3 Agreement Rules (commission rates)
1 Ingestion Run (with COMPLETED status)
27 Staging Payloads (9 MEV + 9 Fees per validator)
9 CanonicalValidatorMEV records (3 validators × 3 epochs)
9 CanonicalValidatorFees records (3 validators × 3 epochs)
9 ValidatorPnL records (3 validators × 3 epochs)
```

**Validators Seeded:**
1. `7Np41oeYqPefeNQEHSv1UDhYrehxin3NStELsSKCT4K2` (Certus One)
2. `J2nUHEAgZFRyuJbFjdqPrAa9gyWDuc7hErtDQHPhsYRp` (Jump Crypto)
3. `CertusDeBmqN8ZawdkxK5kFGMwBXdudvWHYwtNgNhvLu` (Certus)

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/seed_mvp_data.py` (854 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `README.md` - Added "Seed Database with Test Data" section, updated Development Status

**Problem Solved: Enum Value Mismatch**
- **Issue**: `LookupError: 'admin' is not among the defined enum values`
- **Root Cause**: Database migration created role as `String(20)` instead of enum type
- **Solution**: Modified admin user check to query only `User.id` instead of full `User` object to avoid enum deserialization:
  ```python
  # Query ID only to avoid enum deserialization
  result = await session.execute(
      select(User.id).where(User.username == "admin")
  )
  existing_id = result.scalar_one_or_none()
  ```

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Script runs without errors and populates database
- ✅ Script is fully idempotent (can run multiple times safely)
- ✅ Seeded data includes: admin user, chains, providers, periods
- ✅ 3 Solana validators with realistic vote pubkeys
- ✅ 2 partners with contact information
- ✅ 2 active agreements with commission rules
- ✅ ValidatorPnL data for last 3 Solana epochs
- ✅ CanonicalValidatorMEV and CanonicalValidatorFees records
- ✅ Realistic amounts (50 SOL fees, 30 SOL MEV, 100 SOL rewards per epoch)
- ✅ Commission rates: 10% and 15% on MEV_TIPS
- ✅ Full data traceability through staging layer
- ✅ All foreign key relationships valid
- ✅ README.md updated with seed script usage instructions

**Validation Results:**
```bash
poetry run python scripts/seed_mvp_data.py

✓ Seeded: 1 chain
✓ Seeded: 1 provider
✓ Admin user created/exists
✓ Seeded: 3 validators
✓ Seeded: 2 partners

      "period_id": "uuid",
      "validator_key": "A1b2C3...",
      "commission_amount_native": "1234567890",
      "computed_at": "2025-10-31T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create endpoint in `src/api/routers/commissions.py`
2. Query `partner_commission_lines` table
3. Order by `computed_at DESC`
4. Limit results and return list

### 2. Validators CRUD Endpoints (Medium Priority)

#### Database Schema: validators table
```sql
CREATE TABLE validators (
    validator_key VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    chain_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL REFERENCES chains(chain_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    description TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (validator_key, chain_id),
    CONSTRAINT ck_validator_key_not_empty CHECK (validator_key <> '')
);

CREATE INDEX idx_validators_chain ON validators(chain_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_validators_active ON validators(is_active);
```

---

#### GET /api/v1/validators
**Purpose**: List all validators with pagination and filtering

**Query Parameters**:
- `chain_id` (optional): Filter by chain
- `page` (optional, default: 1): Page number
- `page_size` (optional, default: 10): Items per page

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "total": 50,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 10,
  "data": [
    {
      "validator_key": "A1b2C3...",
      "chain_id": "solana-mainnet",
      "description": "Main validator",
      "is_active": true,
      "created_at": "2025-10-01T00:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-10-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create `validators` table via Alembic migration
2. Create repository in `src/repositories/validators.py` (registry methods)
3. Create service in `src/core/services/validators.py`
4. Implement endpoint with pagination and filtering
5. Return paginated response

---

#### POST /api/v1/validators
**Purpose**: Create a new validator

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "validator_key": "A1b2C3d4E5...",
  "chain_id": "solana-mainnet",
  "description": "Optional description"
}
```

**Validation**:
- `validator_key`: Required, 32-44 characters, base58 format
- `chain_id`: Required, must exist in chains.yaml
- `description`: Optional, max 500 characters

**Expected Response**: `201 Created` (same structure as GET)

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Validate input using Pydantic schema
2. Check for duplicate (validator_key, chain_id)
3. Insert into `validators` table
4. Return created record

---

#### PATCH /api/v1/validators/{validator_key}/{chain_id}
**Purpose**: Update validator description or active status

**Request Body** (all optional):
```json
{
  "description": "Updated description",
  "is_active": false
}
```

**Expected Response**: `200 OK` (updated validator record)

---

#### DELETE /api/v1/validators/{validator_key}/{chain_id}
**Purpose**: Delete a validator

**Expected Response**: `204 No Content`

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Find validator by composite key
2. Check for dependencies (P&L records, etc.)
3. Soft delete (set `is_active=false`) or hard delete
4. Return 204 on success, 404 if not found

---

### Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 - Dashboard Operational** (2-3 hours):
1. ✅ `GET /api/v1/validators/stats`
2. ✅ `GET /api/v1/partners/count`
3. ✅ `GET /api/v1/agreements/count`

**Phase 2 - Basic Validators CRUD** (3-4 hours):
4. ✅ Create `validators` table migration
5. ✅ `GET /api/v1/validators` (list with filters)
6. ✅ `POST /api/v1/validators` (create)

**Phase 3 - Full Validators CRUD** (2-3 hours):
7. ⚠️ `PATCH /api/v1/validators/{key}/{chain}` (update)
8. ⚠️ `DELETE /api/v1/validators/{key}/{chain}` (delete)

**Phase 4 - Optional Enhancement** (1-2 hours):
9. ⚠️ `GET /api/v1/commissions/recent` (recent commissions)

**Total Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours for complete implementation

## Completed Work Summary

### Data Layer (Issues #6, #7, #8, #9)
- ✅ **Issue #6**: Chain registry models (Chain, Provider, ChainProviderMapping, CanonicalPeriod, CanonicalValidatorIdentity)
- ✅ **Issue #7**: Staging layer models (IngestionRun, StagingPayload + enums)
- ✅ **Issue #8**: Canonical layer models (CanonicalValidatorFees, CanonicalValidatorMEV, CanonicalStakeRewards, CanonicalValidatorMeta)
- ✅ **Issue #9**: Computation layer models (ValidatorPnL, Partners, Agreements, AgreementVersions, AgreementRules, PartnerCommissionLines, PartnerCommissionStatements)

### Database Migrations (Issue #10)
- ✅ **Issue #10**: Alembic migrations with async SQLAlchemy support, management scripts, and comprehensive documentation

### Infrastructure (Issue #3 + Security)
- ✅ **Issue #3**: PostgreSQL + Redis Docker Compose setup
- ✅ **Security**: Input validation, SQL injection protection (`src/core/security.py`)
- ✅ **Logging**: Structured logging with PII filtering (`src/core/logging.py`)
- ✅ **Testing**: Async database fixtures with per-test isolation

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### ORM Model Organization
- **Pattern**: Group related models by domain in single files
- **Examples**:
  - `chains.py` - Chain registry and configuration (5 models)
  - `staging.py` - Data ingestion (2 models + 2 enums)
  - `canonical.py` - Normalized data (4 models)
  - `computation.py` - P&L and commissions (pending Issue #9)
- **Rationale**: Better cohesion, easier to understand relationships, prevents file proliferation

### Database Precision
- **NUMERIC(38,18)** for all blockchain-native amounts (lamports, wei, gwei)
- Maintains 18 decimal places of precision
- Prevents floating-point arithmetic errors
- Supports both Solana (lamports: 10^9 per SOL) and Ethereum (wei: 10^18 per ETH)

### Data Traceability
- Every canonical model has `source_provider_id` and `source_payload_id`
- Full audit trail from raw staging data to normalized canonical data
- Enables debugging, verification, and re-computation

### Testing Strategy
- Async database fixtures with per-test isolation
- Real database operations (not mocked)
- Each test: create tables → test → drop tables
- 100% coverage requirement for new ORM models

### Reference Patterns for MVP Implementation

**Essential Reading Before Starting:**
1. `docs/mvp-plan.md` - Comprehensive MVP specification (500+ lines)
2. `docs/mvp-implementation-order.md` - Day-by-day implementation guide
3. GitHub Epic #28 - Master tracking issue with dependencies
4. Specific GitHub issue for current phase (e.g., Issue #18 for Phase 1)

**General Implementation Pattern:**
1. Read the specific phase documentation thoroughly
2. Review acceptance criteria in the GitHub issue
3. Check dependencies are complete (previous phases done)
4. Implement according to specifications
5. Write comprehensive tests (unit + integration)
6. Run all quality gates: mypy ✅ ruff ✅ black ✅ pytest ✅
7. Update GitHub issue with progress
8. Mark phase complete when all acceptance criteria met

**For Backend Work (Issues #18-20):**
1. Use FastAPI for all REST endpoints
2. Use Pydantic for request/response validation
3. Use SQLAlchemy 2.0 async for database operations
4. Follow existing model patterns in `src/core/models/`
5. Implement business logic in service layer, not controllers
6. Add comprehensive error handling with ProviderError hierarchy
7. Use JWT authentication (python-jose) for protected endpoints
8. Test with pytest async fixtures

**For Frontend Work (Issues #22-25):**
1. Use React 18 + TypeScript with strict mode
2. Use Material-UI for all UI components (no custom styling)
3. Use React Router for navigation
4. Use React Query for data fetching and caching
5. Use Axios for HTTP client with interceptors
6. Store JWT in localStorage
7. Implement proper loading and error states
8. Follow existing TypeScript patterns for type safety

**For ORM-related work** (if creating new models), reference established patterns:
1. Review `docs/database-schema.md` for schema specifications
2. Use existing models in `src/core/models/` as reference
3. Use NUMERIC(38,18) for all blockchain amount fields
4. Include source attribution fields for traceability
5. Add bidirectional relationships to related models
6. Implement all constraints (check, unique, foreign key)
7. Write comprehensive tests with 100% code coverage
8. Create migrations: `./scripts/migrate.sh create "message"`
9. Test migrations: upgrade → downgrade → upgrade

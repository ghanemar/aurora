**Critical Path Dependencies:**
```
Phase 1 (Backend) → Phase 2a (Schemas) → Phase 2b (Services) → Phase 3 (Seeding)
                                                                        ↓

                                                                        ↓
                                  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┐
                                  ↓                                     ↓                                 ↓
                            Phase 5a (Dashboard)              Phase 5b (Partners)              Phase 5c (Commissions)
                                  └─────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┘
                                                                        ↓

```

**Key Decisions:**
- **Fast-track timeline**: 2-3 weeks to working demo (vs 6-8 weeks for full implementation)
- **Seeded data strategy**: Use realistic test data to avoid 2-3 week ingestion pipeline build
- **Admin-only auth**: Defer partner portal to post-MVP (saves 1 week)
- **CLIENT_REVENUE method only**: Simple commission calculation (10% of revenue) for MVP
- **Desktop-only UI**: Responsive design deferred to post-MVP
- **Optional stretch goal**: Real data integration if all phases complete early

**Out of Scope (Post-MVP):**
- ❌ Partner login portal
- ❌ Payment tracking and status
- ❌ Multi-chain support beyond Solana (Ethereum deferred to M1)
- ❌ Automated data ingestion pipelines
- ❌ Advanced commission methods

- Check constraints: positive amounts, commission_rate_bps 0-10000, uptime_percentage 0-100
- Composite indexes on (chain_id, period_id, validator_key) for query performance

#### Issue #21 - MVP Phase 3: Data Seeding Script (COMPLETED 2025-10-29)

**What was completed:**
- ✅ Comprehensive idempotent seed script (`scripts/seed_mvp_data.py`)
- ✅ Realistic Solana mainnet test data with 3 validators
- ✅ 2 partners with active agreements and commission rules
- ✅ 3 epochs of financial data (epochs 850-852)
- ✅ Complete staging layer with ingestion runs and payloads
- ✅ Full data traceability from staging to canonical to computation
- ✅ PostgreSQL idempotency using INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
- ✅ Fixed enum value handling for User model
- ✅ README.md updated with seeding instructions

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Realistic Amounts**: Per validator per epoch:
  - Execution Fees: 50 SOL (50,000,000,000 lamports)
  - MEV Tips: 30 SOL (30,000,000,000 lamports)
  - Vote Rewards: 100 SOL (100,000,000,000 lamports)
  - Total Revenue: 180 SOL per validator per epoch
- **Commission Structure**:
  - Partner 1: 10% (1000 bps) on MEV_TIPS for validators 1-2
  - Partner 2: 15% (1500 bps) on MEV_TIPS for validator 3
- **Idempotency Pattern**: Used `on_conflict_do_nothing(index_elements=[...])` for all inserts
- **Full Traceability**: IngestionRun → StagingPayload → Canonical → ValidatorPnL
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: For staging payload response_hash

**Seed Data Structure:**
```
1 Admin User (admin/admin123)
1 Chain (solana-mainnet)
1 Provider (Jito)
3 Validators (real mainnet vote pubkeys)
2 Partners (Global Stake Partners, Decentralized Validators Group)
3 Canonical Periods (epochs 850-852)
2 Agreements (ACTIVE status)
2 Agreement Versions (version 1)
3 Agreement Rules (commission rates)
1 Ingestion Run (with COMPLETED status)
27 Staging Payloads (9 MEV + 9 Fees per validator)
9 CanonicalValidatorMEV records (3 validators × 3 epochs)
9 CanonicalValidatorFees records (3 validators × 3 epochs)
9 ValidatorPnL records (3 validators × 3 epochs)
```

**Validators Seeded:**
1. `7Np41oeYqPefeNQEHSv1UDhYrehxin3NStELsSKCT4K2` (Certus One)
2. `J2nUHEAgZFRyuJbFjdqPrAa9gyWDuc7hErtDQHPhsYRp` (Jump Crypto)
3. `CertusDeBmqN8ZawdkxK5kFGMwBXdudvWHYwtNgNhvLu` (Certus)

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/seed_mvp_data.py` (854 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `README.md` - Added "Seed Database with Test Data" section, updated Development Status

**Problem Solved: Enum Value Mismatch**
- **Issue**: `LookupError: 'admin' is not among the defined enum values`
- **Root Cause**: Database migration created role as `String(20)` instead of enum type
- **Solution**: Modified admin user check to query only `User.id` instead of full `User` object to avoid enum deserialization:
  ```python
  # Query ID only to avoid enum deserialization
  result = await session.execute(
      select(User.id).where(User.username == "admin")
  )
  existing_id = result.scalar_one_or_none()
  ```

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Script runs without errors and populates database
- ✅ Script is fully idempotent (can run multiple times safely)
- ✅ Seeded data includes: admin user, chains, providers, periods
- ✅ 3 Solana validators with realistic vote pubkeys
- ✅ 2 partners with contact information
- ✅ 2 active agreements with commission rules
- ✅ ValidatorPnL data for last 3 Solana epochs
- ✅ CanonicalValidatorMEV and CanonicalValidatorFees records
- ✅ Realistic amounts (50 SOL fees, 30 SOL MEV, 100 SOL rewards per epoch)
- ✅ Commission rates: 10% and 15% on MEV_TIPS
- ✅ Full data traceability through staging layer
- ✅ All foreign key relationships valid
- ✅ README.md updated with seed script usage instructions

**Validation Results:**
```bash
poetry run python scripts/seed_mvp_data.py

✓ Seeded: 1 chain
✓ Seeded: 1 provider
✓ Admin user created/exists
✓ Seeded: 3 validators
✓ Seeded: 2 partners

{
  "data": [
    {
      "commission_id": "uuid",
      "agreement_id": "uuid",
      "period_id": "uuid",
      "validator_key": "A1b2C3...",
      "commission_amount_native": "1234567890",
      "computed_at": "2025-10-31T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create endpoint in `src/api/routers/commissions.py`
2. Query `partner_commission_lines` table
3. Order by `computed_at DESC`
4. Limit results and return list

### 2. Validators CRUD Endpoints (Medium Priority)

#### Database Schema: validators table
```sql
CREATE TABLE validators (
    validator_key VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    chain_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL REFERENCES chains(chain_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    description TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (validator_key, chain_id),
    CONSTRAINT ck_validator_key_not_empty CHECK (validator_key <> '')
);

CREATE INDEX idx_validators_chain ON validators(chain_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_validators_active ON validators(is_active);
```

---

#### GET /api/v1/validators
**Purpose**: List all validators with pagination and filtering

**Query Parameters**:
- `chain_id` (optional): Filter by chain
- `page` (optional, default: 1): Page number
- `page_size` (optional, default: 10): Items per page

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "total": 50,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 10,
  "data": [
    {
      "validator_key": "A1b2C3...",
      "chain_id": "solana-mainnet",
      "description": "Main validator",
      "is_active": true,

      "updated_at": "2025-10-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create `validators` table via Alembic migration
2. Create repository in `src/repositories/validators.py` (registry methods)
3. Create service in `src/core/services/validators.py`
4. Implement endpoint with pagination and filtering
5. Return paginated response

---

#### POST /api/v1/validators
**Purpose**: Create a new validator

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "validator_key": "A1b2C3d4E5...",
  "chain_id": "solana-mainnet",
  "description": "Optional description"
}
```

**Validation**:
- `validator_key`: Required, 32-44 characters, base58 format
- `chain_id`: Required, must exist in chains.yaml
- `description`: Optional, max 500 characters

**Expected Response**: `201 Created` (same structure as GET)

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Validate input using Pydantic schema
2. Check for duplicate (validator_key, chain_id)
3. Insert into `validators` table
4. Return created record

---

#### PATCH /api/v1/validators/{validator_key}/{chain_id}
**Purpose**: Update validator description or active status

**Request Body** (all optional):
```json
{
  "description": "Updated description",
  "is_active": false
}
```

**Expected Response**: `200 OK` (updated validator record)

---

#### DELETE /api/v1/validators/{validator_key}/{chain_id}
**Purpose**: Delete a validator

**Expected Response**: `204 No Content`

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Find validator by composite key
2. Check for dependencies (P&L records, etc.)
3. Soft delete (set `is_active=false`) or hard delete
4. Return 204 on success, 404 if not found

## Completed Work Summary

### Data Layer (Issues #6, #7, #8, #9)
- ✅ **Issue #6**: Chain registry models (Chain, Provider, ChainProviderMapping, CanonicalPeriod, CanonicalValidatorIdentity)
- ✅ **Issue #7**: Staging layer models (IngestionRun, StagingPayload + enums)
- ✅ **Issue #8**: Canonical layer models (CanonicalValidatorFees, CanonicalValidatorMEV, CanonicalStakeRewards, CanonicalValidatorMeta)
- ✅ **Issue #9**: Computation layer models (ValidatorPnL, Partners, Agreements, AgreementVersions, AgreementRules, PartnerCommissionLines, PartnerCommissionStatements)

### Database Migrations (Issue #10)
- ✅ **Issue #10**: Alembic migrations with async SQLAlchemy support, management scripts, and comprehensive documentation

### Infrastructure (Issue #3 + Security)
- ✅ **Issue #3**: PostgreSQL + Redis Docker Compose setup
- ✅ **Security**: Input validation, SQL injection protection (`src/core/security.py`)
- ✅ **Logging**: Structured logging with PII filtering (`src/core/logging.py`)
- ✅ **Testing**: Async database fixtures with per-test isolation

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### ORM Model Organization
- **Pattern**: Group related models by domain in single files
- **Examples**:
  - `chains.py` - Chain registry and configuration (5 models)
  - `staging.py` - Data ingestion (2 models + 2 enums)
  - `canonical.py` - Normalized data (4 models)
  - `computation.py` - P&L and commissions (pending Issue #9)
- **Rationale**: Better cohesion, easier to understand relationships, prevents file proliferation

### Database Precision
- **NUMERIC(38,18)** for all blockchain-native amounts (lamports, wei, gwei)
- Maintains 18 decimal places of precision
- Prevents floating-point arithmetic errors
- Supports both Solana (lamports: 10^9 per SOL) and Ethereum (wei: 10^18 per ETH)

### Data Traceability
- Every canonical model has `source_provider_id` and `source_payload_id`
- Full audit trail from raw staging data to normalized canonical data
- Enables debugging, verification, and re-computation

### Testing Strategy
- Async database fixtures with per-test isolation
- Real database operations (not mocked)
- Each test: create tables → test → drop tables
- 100% coverage requirement for new ORM models

## Context for Continuation

### Reference Patterns for MVP Implementation

**Essential Reading Before Starting:**
1. `docs/mvp-plan.md` - Comprehensive MVP specification (500+ lines)
2. `docs/mvp-implementation-order.md` - Day-by-day implementation guide
3. GitHub Epic #28 - Master tracking issue with dependencies
4. Specific GitHub issue for current phase (e.g., Issue #18 for Phase 1)

**General Implementation Pattern:**
1. Read the specific phase documentation thoroughly
2. Review acceptance criteria in the GitHub issue
3. Check dependencies are complete (previous phases done)
4. Implement according to specifications
5. Write comprehensive tests (unit + integration)
6. Run all quality gates: mypy ✅ ruff ✅ black ✅ pytest ✅
7. Update GitHub issue with progress
8. Mark phase complete when all acceptance criteria met

**For Backend Work (Issues #18-20):**
1. Use FastAPI for all REST endpoints
2. Use Pydantic for request/response validation
3. Use SQLAlchemy 2.0 async for database operations
4. Follow existing model patterns in `src/core/models/`
5. Implement business logic in service layer, not controllers
6. Add comprehensive error handling with ProviderError hierarchy
7. Use JWT authentication (python-jose) for protected endpoints
8. Test with pytest async fixtures

**For Frontend Work (Issues #22-25):**
1. Use React 18 + TypeScript with strict mode
2. Use Material-UI for all UI components (no custom styling)
3. Use React Router for navigation
4. Use React Query for data fetching and caching
5. Use Axios for HTTP client with interceptors
6. Store JWT in localStorage
7. Implement proper loading and error states
8. Follow existing TypeScript patterns for type safety

**For ORM-related work** (if creating new models), reference established patterns:
1. Review `docs/database-schema.md` for schema specifications
2. Use existing models in `src/core/models/` as reference
3. Use NUMERIC(38,18) for all blockchain amount fields
4. Include source attribution fields for traceability
5. Add bidirectional relationships to related models
6. Implement all constraints (check, unique, foreign key)
7. Write comprehensive tests with 100% code coverage
8. Create migrations: `./scripts/migrate.sh create "message"`
9. Test migrations: upgrade → downgrade → upgrade

## Upcoming Work: Wallet Attribution System

### Overview

**Goal**: Enable wallet-level commission attribution where partners introduce staking wallets, and commissions are calculated based ONLY on rewards from those specific wallets.

**Business Requirements Confirmed**:
1. Partners introduce delegator/staker wallets that stake TO our validators
2. Commission = SUM(rewards_from_partner_introduced_wallets) × commission_rate
3. Wallet exclusivity: One wallet belongs to only ONE partner (UNIQUE constraint)
4. Retroactive support: Partners can upload wallets with historical introduced_date
5. Staking lifecycle: System validates periods when wallet was actually staking
6. Agreement-level setting: wallet_attribution_enabled applies to ALL rules in agreement
7. Calendar integration: Users can select date ranges that auto-map to epochs
8. Recalculation: Admin can retroactively recalculate commissions after uploading wallets

**Estimated Timeline**: 4.5 developer days (Issues #29-31)

---

### Architecture Overview

#### Data Model

**New Tables:**

1. **`partner_wallets`** - Tracks which wallets belong to which partners
   - wallet_id (PK)
   - partner_id (FK → partners)
   - chain_id (FK → chains)
   - wallet_address (staker/delegator public key)
   - introduced_date (supports retroactive attribution)
   - is_active (soft delete support)
   - UNIQUE(chain_id, wallet_address) - wallet exclusivity

2. **`canonical_stake_events`** - Tracks staking/unstaking lifecycle
   - stake_event_id (PK)
   - chain_id (FK → chains)
   - period_id (FK → canonical_periods)
   - validator_key
   - staker_address
   - event_type (STAKE, UNSTAKE, RESTAKE)
   - stake_amount_native
   - event_timestamp
   - source_provider_id, source_payload_id (data lineage)

3. **`canonical_staker_rewards_detail`** - Per-staker reward granularity
   - staker_reward_id (PK)
   - chain_id (FK → chains)
   - period_id (FK → canonical_periods)
   - validator_key
   - staker_address
   - reward_amount_native
   - revenue_component (EXEC_FEES, MEV, REWARDS)
   - source_provider_id, source_payload_id
   - UNIQUE(chain_id, period_id, validator_key, staker_address, revenue_component)

**Enhanced Tables:**

1. **`agreements`** - Add wallet_attribution_enabled (agreement-level setting)
2. **`partner_commission_lines`** - Add wallet_address (for attribution tracking)

---

### Implementation Plan

#### **Issue #29: Database & Backend Foundation** (2 days)

**Phase 1: Database Migrations**

Create 3 migrations:
1. `add_partner_wallets_table.py`
2. `add_canonical_stake_events_table.py`
3. `add_canonical_staker_rewards_detail_table.py`
4. `enhance_agreements_commission_attribution.py`

**Phase 2: ORM Models**

Update models:
- `src/core/models/chains.py` - Add CanonicalStakeEvent, CanonicalStakerRewardsDetail
- `src/core/models/computation.py` - Add PartnerWallet, enhance Agreement

**Phase 3: Repositories**

Create repositories:
- `src/repositories/partner_wallets.py` - PartnerWalletsRepository
- `src/repositories/staker_rewards.py` - StakerRewardsRepository
- `src/repositories/stake_events.py` - StakeEventsRepository

**Phase 4: Services**

Create/enhance services:
- `src/core/services/partner_wallets.py` - CSV parsing, validation, wallet CRUD
- `src/core/services/commissions.py` - Add wallet attribution logic with lifecycle validation

**Key Logic: Wallet Attribution Calculation**
```python
async def calculate_wallet_attributed_commission(
    partner_id: UUID,
    period_ids: list[UUID],
    validator_key: str | None = None,
) -> CommissionBreakdown:
    # 1. Get partner wallets
    wallets = await get_partner_wallets(partner_id, is_active=True)

    # 2. For each period:
    for period_id in period_ids:
        period = await get_period(period_id)

        # 3. Filter wallets by introduced_date (retroactive support)
        eligible_wallets = [
            w for w in wallets
            if w.introduced_date <= period.start_time.date()
        ]

        # 4. Check staking status (lifecycle validation)
        for wallet in eligible_wallets:
            is_staked = await is_wallet_staked_in_period(
                wallet.wallet_address,
                wallet.chain_id,
                period_id,
                validator_key
            )

            if not is_staked:
                continue  # Skip if wallet not staking in this period

            # 5. Get staker rewards for this wallet
            rewards = await get_staker_rewards(
                chain_id=wallet.chain_id,
                period_id=period_id,
                validator_key=validator_key,
                staker_address=wallet.wallet_address
            )

            # 6. Calculate commission
            for reward in rewards:
                commission = reward.amount × rule.commission_rate_bps / 10000
                # Create commission line...
```

**Phase 5: API Endpoints**

Create new router: `src/api/routers/partner_wallets.py`
- POST /api/v1/partners/{id}/wallets - Single wallet upload
- POST /api/v1/partners/{id}/wallets/bulk - CSV bulk upload
- GET /api/v1/partners/{id}/wallets - List with pagination/filters
- DELETE /api/v1/partners/{id}/wallets/{wallet_id} - Soft delete
- GET /api/v1/partners/{id}/wallets/export - Export CSV

Enhance existing router: `src/api/routers/periods.py`
- GET /api/v1/periods/by-date-range?chain_id=X&start_date=Y&end_date=Z

Enhance existing router: `src/api/routers/commissions.py`
- Update GET /api/v1/commissions/partners/{id}/breakdown
  - Add query params: start_date, end_date, recalculate
  - Support wallet attribution mode
  - Return wallet-level breakdown

**Phase 6: Test Data Seeding**

Update `scripts/seed_mvp_data.py`:
- Seed 50 partner wallets (25 per partner)
- Seed 300 staker reward records (100 per validator × 3 epochs)
- Seed 150 stake event records (stake/unstake lifecycle)
- Set wallet_attribution_enabled = true for one agreement

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Can upload partner wallets with retroactive dates
- ✅ UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicate wallet claims
- ✅ CSV bulk upload validates format and reports errors
- ✅ Date range → epoch mapping works correctly
- ✅ Wallet attribution calculation respects:
  - introduced_date (only rewards after this date)
  - Staking lifecycle (only rewards when wallet was staking)
- ✅ Backward compatible (non-wallet agreements still work)
- ✅ All tests passing with realistic seed data

---

---

#### **Issue #31: Enhanced Commission Calculation UI** (1.5 days)

**Phase 1: Enhanced CommissionsPage**

Update `frontend/src/pages/CommissionsPage.tsx`:

New features:
1. Chain filter (filters validators by chain)
2. Validator filter (optional, defaults to all)
3. Date range picker OR manual epoch selection (toggle)
4. Recalculate checkbox (for retroactive calculation)

New state:
```typescript
const [selectedChain, setSelectedChain] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [selectedValidator, setSelectedValidator] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [dateRange, setDateRange] = useState<[Date | null, Date | null]>([null, null]);
const [manualPeriods, setManualPeriods] = useState<Period[]>([]);
const [useManualPeriods, setUseManualPeriods] = useState(false);
const [recalculateMode, setRecalculateMode] = useState(false);
```

Auto-fetch epochs from date range:
```typescript
const { data: periodsByDate } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['periods-by-date', selectedChain, dateRange],
  queryFn: () => commissionsService.getPeriodsByDateRange({
    chain_id: selectedChain!,
    start_date: dateRange[0]!.toISOString().split('T')[0],
    end_date: dateRange[1]!.toISOString().split('T')[0],
  }),
  enabled: !useManualPeriods && !!selectedChain && !!dateRange[0] && !!dateRange[1],
});
```

**Phase 2: Enhanced CommissionResults**

Update `frontend/src/components/CommissionResults.tsx`:

Add wallet breakdown table:
```typescript
interface CommissionResultsProps {
  breakdown: CommissionBreakdown;
  loading?: boolean;
  showWalletBreakdown?: boolean;  // NEW: controlled by calculation_mode
}

// NEW: Wallet-level DataGrid
const walletColumns: GridColDef<WalletCommissionLine>[] = [
  { field: 'wallet_address', headerName: 'Wallet Address', width: 300 },
  { field: 'validator_key', headerName: 'Validator', width: 250 },
  { field: 'chain_id', headerName: 'Chain', width: 120 },
  { field: 'epoch_number', headerName: 'Epoch', width: 100 },
  { field: 'introduced_date', headerName: 'Introduced', width: 120 },
  { field: 'reward_amount_native', headerName: 'Reward (SOL)', width: 150, valueGetter: formatSol },
  { field: 'commission_rate_bps', headerName: 'Rate', width: 100, valueGetter: formatRate },
  { field: 'commission_native', headerName: 'Commission (SOL)', width: 180, valueGetter: formatSol },
];
```

**Phase 3: API Service Updates**

Update `frontend/src/services/commissions.ts`:
```typescript
// NEW: Date range calculation
getCommissionBreakdownByDateRange: async (params: {
  partner_id: string;
  start_date: string;
  end_date: string;
  validator_key?: string;
  recalculate?: boolean;
}): Promise<CommissionBreakdown> => {
  const response = await api.get<CommissionBreakdown>(
    `/api/v1/commissions/partners/${params.partner_id}/breakdown`,
    { params }
  );
  return response.data;
},

// NEW: Fetch epochs by date range
getPeriodsByDateRange: async (params: {
  chain_id: string;
  start_date: string;
  end_date: string;
}): Promise<{ periods: Period[] }> => {
  const response = await api.get<{ periods: Period[] }>(
    '/api/v1/periods/by-date-range',
    { params }
  );
  return response.data;
},
```

**Phase 4: Dependencies**

Add date picker library:
```bash
npm install @mui/x-date-pickers
npm install date-fns  # date adapter
```

**Phase 5: TypeScript Types**

Update `frontend/src/types/index.ts`:
```typescript
export interface WalletCommissionLine {
  wallet_address: string;
  validator_key: string;
  chain_id: string;
  period_id: string;
  epoch_number: number;
  introduced_date: string;
  revenue_component: string;
  base_amount_native: string;
  commission_rate_bps: number;
  commission_native: string;
}

export interface CommissionBreakdown {
  total_commission: string;
  exec_fees_commission: string;
  mev_commission: string;
  rewards_commission: string;
  calculation_mode: 'wallet_attribution' | 'total_revenue';
  wallet_lines?: WalletCommissionLine[];  // Only present if wallet_attribution
  lines: CommissionLine[];
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Chain filter works and filters validators
- ✅ Validator filter works (optional)
- ✅ Date range picker auto-detects epochs from canonical_periods
- ✅ Manual epoch selection works as alternative
- ✅ Toggle between date range and manual selection
- ✅ Recalculate checkbox updates database records
- ✅ Wallet breakdown table appears for wallet-attributed agreements
- ✅ Wallet breakdown shows: address, validator, epoch, introduced_date, rewards, commission
- ✅ Calculation mode badge shows "Wallet Attribution" or "Total Revenue"
- ✅ End-to-end flow works:
  1. Upload partner wallets
  2. Set agreement wallet_attribution_enabled = true
  3. Select partner + date range
  4. Calculate commission
  5. View wallet-level breakdown
  6. Recalculate with updated wallets

### Key Technical Decisions

#### 1. Staking Lifecycle Validation

**Implementation Approach:**
```python
async def is_wallet_staked_in_period(
    staker_address: str,

#### 2. Retroactive Commission Calculation

**Strategy:**
- Commission lines stored in `partner_commission_lines` table
- When recalculate=true, DELETE old lines and INSERT new ones
- Keep audit trail via created_at/updated_at timestamps
- Commission statements remain immutable (audit requirement)

**Implementation:**
```python
async def recalculate_commissions(
    partner_id: UUID,
    start_date: date,
    end_date: date,
) -> CommissionBreakdown:
    # 1. Calculate new breakdown
    breakdown = await calculate_commission_breakdown(...)

    # 2. Delete old commission lines for this period
    await db.execute(
        delete(PartnerCommissionLine)
        .where(
            PartnerCommissionLine.partner_id == partner_id,
            PartnerCommissionLine.period_id.in_(period_ids)
        )
    )

    # 3. Insert new commission lines
    for line in breakdown.wallet_lines or breakdown.lines:
        await db.execute(
            insert(PartnerCommissionLine).values(...)
        )

    # 4. Update agreement updated_at timestamp
    await db.execute(
        update(Agreement)
        .where(Agreement.agreement_id == agreement_id)
        .values(updated_at=func.now())
    )

    return breakdown
```

#### 3. Date Range → Epoch Mapping

**Dynamic Calculation:**
```python
async def get_periods_by_date_range(
    chain_id: str,
    start_date: date,
    end_date: date,
) -> list[CanonicalPeriod]:
    """
    Find all epochs that overlap with date range.

    Logic:
    - Period overlaps if: period.start_time <= end_date AND period.end_time >= start_date
    """
    result = await db.execute(
        select(CanonicalPeriod)
        .where(
            CanonicalPeriod.chain_id == chain_id,
            CanonicalPeriod.start_time <= datetime.combine(end_date, time.max),
            CanonicalPeriod.end_time >= datetime.combine(start_date, time.min),
        )
        .order_by(CanonicalPeriod.start_time)
    )
    return result.scalars().all()
```

### Test Data Strategy

#### Seed Data Requirements

**Wallets:**
- 50 total wallets (25 per partner)
- Introduced dates: Mix of past/recent (2024-12-01 to 2025-01-15)
- 20 wallets active across all 3 test epochs
- 15 wallets stake/unstake mid-period (test lifecycle)
- 15 wallets introduced after some epochs (test retroactive)

**Stake Events:**
- 150 events total (STAKE, UNSTAKE, RESTAKE)
- Pattern: STAKE → UNSTAKE → STAKE for lifecycle testing
- Some wallets never unstake (still staking)
- Some wallets stake in epoch 1, unstake in epoch 2

**Staker Rewards:**
- 300 records (100 per validator × 3 epochs)
- Varying amounts: 0.5 SOL to 5 SOL per wallet per epoch
- Mix of revenue components: EXEC_FEES, MEV, REWARDS
- Only rewards for wallets that were staking in that period

#### Seed Script Enhancements

Update `scripts/seed_mvp_data.py`:
```python
# 1. Seed partner wallets
partner_1_wallets = [...]  # 25 wallets with varying introduced_dates
partner_2_wallets = [...]  # 25 wallets

# 2. Seed stake events (lifecycle)
stake_events = [
    # Wallet 1: Stake epoch 1, still staking
    (wallet_1, 'STAKE', epoch_1_start, validator_1),

    # Wallet 2: Stake epoch 1, unstake epoch 2, restake epoch 3
    (wallet_2, 'STAKE', epoch_1_start, validator_1),
    (wallet_2, 'UNSTAKE', epoch_2_mid, validator_1),
    (wallet_2, 'STAKE', epoch_3_start, validator_1),
    ...
]

# 3. Seed staker rewards (only when staking)
staker_rewards = [
    # Wallet 1: Rewards in all 3 epochs (never unstaked)
    (wallet_1, epoch_1, validator_1, 'REWARDS', 2.5 SOL),
    (wallet_1, epoch_2, validator_1, 'REWARDS', 3.0 SOL),
    (wallet_1, epoch_3, validator_1, 'REWARDS', 2.8 SOL),

    # Wallet 2: Rewards only in epochs 1 and 3 (unstaked in epoch 2)
    (wallet_2, epoch_1, validator_1, 'REWARDS', 1.5 SOL),
    (wallet_2, epoch_3, validator_1, 'REWARDS', 1.8 SOL),
    ...
]

# 4. Set wallet attribution for one agreement
agreement_1.wallet_attribution_enabled = True
```

### Starting Points for Next Session

When beginning implementation, start with:

**1. Read Planning Documents:**
- This HANDOFF.md section (Wallet Attribution System)
- Review current database schema in `docs/database-schema.md`
- Review existing commission calculation in `src/core/services/commissions.py`

**2. Create GitHub Issues:**
Run `/sc:implement` with "Create GitHub issues for wallet attribution system (Issues #29-31)"

**3. Start Issue #29 (Database & Backend):**

Step-by-step approach:
```
Day 1 Morning: Database Migrations
- Create partner_wallets table
- Create canonical_stake_events table
- Create canonical_staker_rewards_detail table
- Enhance agreements table

Day 1 Afternoon: ORM Models & Repositories
- Add models to chains.py and computation.py
- Create PartnerWalletsRepository
- Create StakeEventsRepository
- Create StakerRewardsRepository

Day 2 Morning: Services & Business Logic
- Create PartnerWalletsService (CSV upload, validation)
- Enhance CommissionService with wallet attribution
- Implement staking lifecycle validation logic

Day 2 Afternoon: API Endpoints & Tests
- Create partner_wallets router
- Enhance periods router (date range mapping)
- Enhance commissions router (wallet attribution)
- Update seed script with test data
- Write integration tests
```

**4. Key Files to Reference:**
- Existing commission calculation: `src/core/services/commissions.py`
- Existing agreement rules: `src/core/models/computation.py`
- Existing periods endpoint: `src/api/routers/periods.py`
- CSV upload pattern: Look for similar patterns in partners.py or agreements.py

**5. Testing Checklist:**
After implementation, verify:
- [ ] Can upload 50 partner wallets via CSV
- [ ] UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicate wallet claims
- [ ] Date range (2025-01-01 to 2025-01-31) correctly maps to epochs 850-852
- [ ] Wallet attribution respects introduced_date (no rewards before this date)
- [ ] Wallet attribution respects staking lifecycle (no rewards when unstaked)
- [ ] Recalculate mode updates commission_lines table
- [ ] Backward compatible: agreements with wallet_attribution_enabled=false still work
- [ ] Frontend wallet management page shows all 50 wallets
- [ ] Frontend commission page shows wallet breakdown table
- [ ] End-to-end: upload wallets → calculate → see wallet-level results

## Current Session Status (2025-10-27)

### Active Tasks
**Ready for Issue #11: Data Ingestion Adapters** (recommended next task)

### Recent Completions

#### Issue #10 - Alembic Migrations (COMPLETED 2025-10-27)

**What was completed:**
- ✅ Alembic initialized with async SQLAlchemy support
- ✅ Initial migration generated for all 18 ORM models (chains, staging, canonical, computation)
- ✅ Migration configured with Black auto-formatting hook
- ✅ PostgreSQL ENUM type cleanup in downgrade function
- ✅ Migration tested: upgrade → downgrade → upgrade cycle
- ✅ Migration management script created (`scripts/migrate.sh`)
- ✅ Comprehensive migration guide (`docs/migration-guide.md`)
- ✅ All quality gates passing: mypy ✅ ruff ✅ black ✅

**Key features:**
- Async SQLAlchemy engine support via `run_sync()`
- Auto-detection of model changes for future migrations
- Environment variable configuration (DATABASE_URL from settings)
- Proper handling of PostgreSQL ENUM types in downgrades
- Multi-environment support (dev, staging, prod)
- Management script with upgrade, downgrade, history, current, create, reset commands

**Database state:**
- 18 tables created: chains, providers, chain_provider_mappings, canonical_periods, canonical_validator_identities, partners, agreements, agreement_versions, agreement_rules, ingestion_runs, staging_payloads, canonical_validator_fees, canonical_validator_mev, canonical_stake_rewards, canonical_validator_meta, validator_pnl, partner_commission_lines, partner_commission_statements
- 4 ENUM types: ingestionstatus, datatype, agreementstatus, revenuecomponent, attributionmethod, statementstatus
- Current revision: cec3a80e61a4 (head)

#### Issue #9 - Computation Layer ORM Models (COMPLETED 2025-10-27)

**What was completed:**
- ✅ 7 models: ValidatorPnL, Partners, Agreements, AgreementVersions, AgreementRules, PartnerCommissionLines, PartnerCommissionStatements
- ✅ 4 enums: AgreementStatus, RevenueComponent, AttributionMethod, StatementStatus
- ✅ Bidirectional relationships with Chain and CanonicalPeriod models
- ✅ 22 comprehensive unit tests with 100% code coverage for computation.py
- ✅ All quality gates passing: mypy ✅ ruff ✅ black ✅ pytest (122 tests)
- ✅ Test coverage improved to 84%
- ✅ Fixed SQLAlchemy reserved name (`metadata` → `statement_metadata`)
- ✅ Proper cascade delete handling for Agreement relationships

**Key design patterns:**
- NUMERIC(38,18) for all revenue amounts
- CASCADE delete for chain/period (data lifecycle)
- RESTRICT delete for partner/agreement (data protection)
- Composite foreign keys for agreement versioning
- Check constraints: positive amounts, valid rate ranges (0-10000 bps)
- Unique constraints: preventing duplicate P&L records and commission statements

#### Issue #8 - Canonical Layer ORM Models (COMPLETED 2025-10-26)

**What was completed:**
- ✅ 4 canonical models: CanonicalValidatorFees, CanonicalValidatorMEV, CanonicalStakeRewards, CanonicalValidatorMeta
- ✅ All models use NUMERIC(38,18) precision for blockchain-native amounts (lamports, wei)
- ✅ Unique constraints on (chain_id, period_id, validator_key) for Fees, MEV, Meta
- ✅ CanonicalStakeRewards supports both aggregated and per-staker detail (staker_address NULL vs populated)
- ✅ Full source attribution via source_provider_id and source_payload_id for traceability
- ✅ Bidirectional relationships with Chain, CanonicalPeriod, Provider, and StagingPayload
- ✅ 11 comprehensive unit tests with 100% code coverage for canonical.py
- ✅ All quality gates passing: mypy ✅ ruff ✅ black ✅ pytest (100 tests)
- ✅ Test coverage improved to 79%

**Key design patterns:**
- CASCADE delete for chain/period (data lifecycle)
- RESTRICT delete for provider/staging (data protection)
- Check constraints: positive amounts, commission_rate_bps 0-10000, uptime_percentage 0-100
- Composite indexes on (chain_id, period_id, validator_key) for query performance

### Pending Tasks

**Recommended Next: Issue #11 - Data Ingestion Adapters**

Why Issue #11 makes sense now:
- Complete data layer ready: ✅ chains ✅ staging ✅ canonical ✅ computation
- Database migrations in place: ✅ Alembic configured
- Data flow progression: **Ingestion** → Staging → Canonical → Computation
- Core infrastructure established for adapter development
- Medium complexity (5-7 days effort) - blockchain provider adapters

**Adapters to implement** (see GitHub Issues #11-14):
- Issue #11: Solana validator data adapter (epoch rewards, fees, MEV)
- Issue #12: Ethereum validator data adapter (execution fees, MEV)
- Issue #13: Provider API client abstraction layer
- Issue #14: Ingestion orchestration and error handling

**Other Open Issues:**
- Issues #4-5: Authentication & RBAC (can be done anytime)
- Issues #15-17: Services & API (requires adapters for full functionality)

## Completed Work Summary

### Data Layer (Issues #6, #7, #8, #9)
- ✅ **Issue #6**: Chain registry models (Chain, Provider, ChainProviderMapping, CanonicalPeriod, CanonicalValidatorIdentity)
- ✅ **Issue #7**: Staging layer models (IngestionRun, StagingPayload + enums)
- ✅ **Issue #8**: Canonical layer models (CanonicalValidatorFees, CanonicalValidatorMEV, CanonicalStakeRewards, CanonicalValidatorMeta)
- ✅ **Issue #9**: Computation layer models (ValidatorPnL, Partners, Agreements, AgreementVersions, AgreementRules, PartnerCommissionLines, PartnerCommissionStatements)

### Database Migrations (Issue #10)
- ✅ **Issue #10**: Alembic migrations with async SQLAlchemy support, management scripts, and comprehensive documentation

### Infrastructure (Issue #3 + Security)
- ✅ **Issue #3**: PostgreSQL + Redis Docker Compose setup
- ✅ **Security**: Input validation, SQL injection protection (`src/core/security.py`)
- ✅ **Logging**: Structured logging with PII filtering (`src/core/logging.py`)
- ✅ **Testing**: Async database fixtures with per-test isolation

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### ORM Model Organization
- **Pattern**: Group related models by domain in single files
- **Examples**:
  - `chains.py` - Chain registry and configuration (5 models)
  - `staging.py` - Data ingestion (2 models + 2 enums)
  - `canonical.py` - Normalized data (4 models)
  - `computation.py` - P&L and commissions (pending Issue #9)
- **Rationale**: Better cohesion, easier to understand relationships, prevents file proliferation

### Database Precision
- **NUMERIC(38,18)** for all blockchain-native amounts (lamports, wei, gwei)
- Maintains 18 decimal places of precision
- Prevents floating-point arithmetic errors
- Supports both Solana (lamports: 10^9 per SOL) and Ethereum (wei: 10^18 per ETH)

### Data Traceability
- Every canonical model has `source_provider_id` and `source_payload_id`
- Full audit trail from raw staging data to normalized canonical data
- Enables debugging, verification, and re-computation

### Testing Strategy
- Async database fixtures with per-test isolation
- Real database operations (not mocked)
- Each test: create tables → test → drop tables
- 100% coverage requirement for new ORM models

## Context for Continuation

### Critical Files
- `docs/ai-context/project-structure.md` - Complete project architecture (v1.5)
- `docs/ai-context/HANDOFF.md` - This file (v2025-10-27)
- `docs/database-schema.md` - Complete database schema specification
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI agent instructions and coding standards
- `src/core/models/` - All ORM models (chains.py, staging.py, canonical.py)
- `src/core/security.py` - Input validation and SQL injection protection
- `src/core/logging.py` - Security-aware structured logging
- `tests/conftest.py` - Async database test fixtures

### Reference Patterns
When implementing Issue #11 (data ingestion adapters), follow the established patterns:
1. Review data provider APIs and authentication requirements
2. Design adapter interface for provider-agnostic data ingestion
3. Implement async HTTP clients with retry logic and rate limiting
4. Use `src/core/models/staging.py` for data storage patterns
5. Implement data transformation: provider format → staging format
6. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
7. Write unit tests with mocked HTTP responses
8. Write integration tests with real API calls (optional flag)
9. Run all quality gates: mypy, ruff, black, pytest

**For ORM-related work**, reference the established model patterns:
1. Review `docs/database-schema.md` for schema specifications
2. Use existing models in `src/core/models/` as reference
3. Use NUMERIC(38,18) for all blockchain amount fields
4. Include source attribution fields for traceability
5. Add bidirectional relationships to related models
6. Implement all constraints (check, unique, foreign key)
7. Write comprehensive tests with 100% code coverage
8. Create migrations: `./scripts/migrate.sh create "message"`
9. Test migrations: upgrade → downgrade → upgrade
